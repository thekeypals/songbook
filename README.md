[Verse 1]
G                         D/F#
On the soccer field I was bound for glory
G                     D/F#        Csus2
Wrap up my calling in eight years tops
G                       D/F#
Bounced around, make my teachers dizzy
G                           D/F#     Csus2
Eights seconds a minute was much too still

G                      D/F#
Scraped my way through classes in high school
G                      D/F#       Csus2
Pencil on paper, eight minutes an hour
G                        D/F#
Worked to the bone, with dreams after college
G                           D/F#      Csus2
Awake for eight pages and I think I’m good

[Chorus 1]
G          F#m              G        F#m
Punched in eight o’clock on my first day of work
G             F#m                      G            F#m      A
Don’t think I even punched out... hmm, what was it? Not even nine?
G                 F#m            G                   F#m
Drifted away many years of mine, koalas and cats and no bitter sunshine
G                        F#m                G                   F#m        A
Think I can handle eight months a year, how anyone does that is not really clear?	

[Verse 2]
G                    D/F#
Couldn’t hold down a job at all
G                  D/F#        Csus2
Gone through eight bosses this week
G                        D/F#
Found the one I long for and dreamed of
G                      D/F#          Csus2
But it lasted only for eight days in all

G                             D/F#
Need a set of different lucky numbers
G                          D/F#         Csus2
Do you think winning eight figures will do?
G                                D/F#
At last I know I’ll find my fame on YouTube
G                         D/F#         Csus2
Can I even cope for eight minutes this week?

[Chorus 2]
G               F#m             G               F#m
Drifted away, I drifted away, I drifted away, I drifted away
G               F#m             G               F#m      A
Drifted away, I drifted away, I drifted away, I drifted away
G                    F#m            G                      F#m
I drifted away, many years of mine, koalas and cats and no bitter sunshine
G                        F#m                G                   F#m        A
Think I can handle eight months a year, how anyone does that is not really clear?

One, two, three, eight!

[Instrumental]

G*  F#sus4add9  E  F  G  A  D  F

[Outro]
The YouTube video was just a take of me rambling about nothing at all for eight minutes straight
It wasn’t very good, it wasn’t very interesting and it just kind of tapered off at the end 
Lifetimes on lifetimes on lifetimes of me just pondering, staring blankly out of the window
I think retirement has suited me well
I think it’s the life I was made for
No, I don’t want to go out, I don’t want to go for a walk, I don’t want to read a book, I don’t want to watch TV even… or go to the meetings, no
I’m good, this is fine

A                D        C#m
Their gazes fell upon one succulent spread
A             D                 C#m
Too polite to begin, small talk reigned instead
     E                  F#                  E            C#m
When Arwen quipped that Christmas shouldn’t wait for any elf
         E                 F#            E               C#m
That the world is ruled by those who can give to themselves
A                   D                     C#m
Pippin cried in the old days they used to get in line
A                  D             C#m
You’d all get some grub, maybe a little wine?
E                   F#         E       C#m
Rina bellowing that she was so very confused
        E                F#             E           C#m
Had the thought police arrived? She was so sweetly amused

Haga lurches for the turkey's carcass, a chain of events and an elvin fracas

[Verse 1]
C#m
Who is paying anyway? It’s not some bleeding giveaway
C#m
Hold the cranberry, horseradish, go find yourself a beggar's dish
F#
After Cirdan’s broadside, Rohan struts with a carving knife
F#
Callon fights like smites like hell with pigs in blankets on his side
C#m
Freda’s front line, caffeine high and over time, kicking up a fuss while
C#m
Bailey spits into the mash and Logon falls into the punch
F#
Garret is a sickening wreck, never seen a battle of the bulge like this
F#
Cancel me once, cancel me twice, but you cannot cancel me all my life

[Pre-Chorus 1]
             A
And then his entrance
             E/G#
Don’t make a sound
           F#/A#
One lonely cough
         B
A little frown

[Chorus 1]
A7          B7          C#m7
Fifty years on in this epic romance
       A7            B7        C#m7
You’ve got to let it go and go dance, dance, dance
         A7             B7              C#m7
We’ll succumb to self destruction under these circumstances
        D                   C#                  E/G#
And the big man says you’ve got to give peace a second chance
        D                   C#                  E/G#
And the big man says you’ve got to give

[Verse 2]
C#m
From the back, a gravy attack, a clique that appears that won't take flack
C#m
Cracker stockpiles are ready to fire, this puddin’ contest is down to the wire
F#
Santa, Lennon, superman, caesar, who do you call when you live in a freezer?
F#
Jack Frost comes and the windows rattle, is he on your side, are you ready for battle?
C#m
Nessa bands merry crew, renouncing dinner, who’s up for stew
C#m
This is the part where we get serious, divide and succour, quite delirious
F#
Feed and succour and ply us with drinks, this new koolaid makes it harder to think
F#
The shame of Kabul, in truth we all share, skating too far and it’s too late to care

[Pre-Chorus 2]
             A
And then the dawn
         E/G#
Of a new idea
                F#/A#
And the big man shudders
               B        C
Turns upon his rear

[Chorus 2]
    A7             B7                  C#m7
The big man that I spoke of, well he’s really just a vision
    A7                B7            C#m7
The peace that we are craving comes from our own volition

[Chorus 1]
A7                G
Harry had a house cooling party
C               D7
Invited all his friends
A7           G
Cool cats in scarves and hats
C                   D7
Turned out in their tens

[Verse 1]
A7                   G
Harry had thought of every little detail
    C
The party of the season
    D7
The only one you need to
A7                         G
Show your face to, for the yuletide who’s who
        C                         D7
Playing music like thunder in the frozen tundra
A7                G
Harry knew how to get things started
     C
With ice cold beers 
    D7
And warm hearted cheers
A7                        G
The AC is pumping and the dance floor is jumping
C                                 D7
Kicking back, angels in the snow, Aurora light show

[Chorus 2]
A7                G
Harry had a house cooling party
C               D7
Invited all his friends

Cool cats in scarves and hats
C                   D7
Turned out in their tens

[Verse 2]
A7             G
They came with good intentions
C         D7
To have a great time
A7             G
They came with good intentions
C            D7 
But lived on borrowed time
A7            G
They bought a thousand fans
C          D7
To keep it so cool
A7         G
But by the end of the night 
C             D7
All merged... one big pool

[Bridge]
G7  C  G7  D7 (x8)

E
A sea of sticks and stones
D
Carrots, plastic gems
G
Each snowman, carefully crafted
E
Had met their ends
D
A sea of sticks and stones
G
Carrots, plastic gems
E
Each snowman, carefully crafted
N.C.
Had met their ends

[Outro]
A7                G
Harry had a house cooling party
C              D7
Killed all his friends

Bugs, millennium bugs
Panic buying, cheesy mugs

Digits ticking, tempting fate
Time’s running out, systems fray
Countdown to chaos, the last day

Ever present, coded thugs
Y2K, a dress rehearsal
Thirty-eight, will see a role reversal

In the ones and zeroes, we all roam
Analog echoes in a digital home
Unix time's ticking, legacy code
Binary echoes, systems implode

[Intro]
(And I said I'm not an alcoholic)

[Verse 1]
     G                 C               D                G
They call us drunks, a scurvy lot, but what do landsmen know?
  G               C              D               G
A hearty drink, a merry shot, is how our spirits grow
    G                    C                 D             G
The kegs are tapped, the tankards shine, a golden, amber gleam
    G                  C           D                    Em
And all is well, we're in command, or so it seems...

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Aye, that was good, I'll have another)

[Chorus 1]
A  G  C  Bb

G  G  A  G (x2)

Another drink! Another drop!
Another drink! Another drop!

C  G  G*  G*

Another drink! Another drop!
Another drink! Another drop!

[Breakdown]
B  C*  B
Shake out a reef
C*  Db  C*
Holystone the deck
Db  D*  Db
Make a prize of her (Handsomely!)
D*  Eb  D*
Take a caulk (Make fast!)
Eb  E  Eb
Belay that! (Mind your top‑hamper)
E  F  E
Beat to quarters! (Hard a‑lee!)
F  Gb  F
Run out the guns! (Abaft the beam)

Splice the main brace (Rake her stem to stern)

Careen the hull (Hands to braces!)

[Verse 2]
G  C  D  G

         G             C
We're in command, this ship is mine
      D                      G
We’re livin’ the privateer’s dream
    G                  C
Our course is set, the passage divine
  D                  G
A perfectly laid out scheme!
         G             C
Through wind and waves, we’re a speck in the haze
      D                      G
My heart beats a drum, the galleon’s ablaze
    G                  C
Strike gold when you fly in the nest, up the mast
  D                  G
In the face of a storm, three sheets is a blast

Am  Am  G  D
Heave-ho!
Am  Am  G  D
Let the kegs loose!
Am  Am  G  D
Fill it again. One more! One pour!
Am  Am  G  D
Fill it again! Again! Again! Fill it again and again and again

        G                     C
There’s rum in the rhythm and bass in the beat
D                   G
One more bottle and I’ll find my feet
G                        C
Spun like a compass, the floor won’t stop
   D                           G
We dance on the waves ‘til the tide gets hot
  G                       C
A cannon for a bass and a parrot that bops
    D                        G
I’m tied to the yards with a full tank top
G                C
Tide’s gone out, so’s the crew
     D                         G                 Em
I’ll perch on this island till I can find you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(They’re all grog-blossomed!)

[Chorus 2]
A  G  C  Bb

G  G  A  G (x2)

N.C.
Another drink! Another drop!
Another drink! Another drop!

[Verse 2]
Emaj7        C#m          C              B7
Stood at the till, slowly losing the will
Emaj7        C#m        G            B7
Lady in front becomes increasingly shrill
Emaj7     C#m        C                B7
Drunk and angry, she looks down the queue
